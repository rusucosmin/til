#Basic file management

### New things learned:

* Safety first: the -i switch
	* `cp -i` and `mv -i` will ask you before overwriting files
	* `rm -i` will ask before deletion
	*  can be combined with other options as well:
		* `rm -Ri` will recursively remove files and ask before deletion
		* `cp -ri` will recursively copu files and ask before deletion
	

###Summary

* Displaying files
	* `cat`, `less`
	* `file` shows type 
* File and directory operations
	* Create: `touch`, `mkdir1
	* Copy: `cp`
	* Move: `mv`
	* Delete: `rm`, `rmdir`
