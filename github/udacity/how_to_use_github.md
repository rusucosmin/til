#How to use Git and GitHub

My notes from the online udacity [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud775/l-2980038599/e-2960778927/m-2960778928) on How to use Git and GitHub.

- `diff`
    - `-u` option -> makes the difference lines easier to read

- `git diff commit_id1 commit_id2`
    - shows the difference between the two commits

- `git log --status`
    - prints a quick preview of every diff a commit have made
