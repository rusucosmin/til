1. Looking at data:
    - Scatter plot
        - plot points
    - Bar Charts
        - better when there's (random) noise in the data
        - pool together several data
        - Histograms - special case of barchart (1D)
    - Pie Chart

2. Simpson's Paradox

3. Probability
    - Conditional Probability
        - Total Probability
        - P(Test) = P(Test | Disease) * P(Disease)
            + P(Test | ~Disease) * P(~Disease)
    - Bayes Rule
        - P(c | pos) = P(c) * P(pos | c) / P(pos)
        - P(~c | pos) = P(~c) * P(pos | ~c) / P(pos)
    - Probability Distribution
    - Correlation vs Causation
    - Estimator
    - Mean, Median and Mode

4. Variance
    - How 'spread' the data is
    - (SUM((x[i] - MEAN) ^ 2) / N)
    - Standard score: z = (X - mean) / var

5. Maximum likely estimator
    - Proof
